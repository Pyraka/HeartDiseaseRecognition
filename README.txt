- For this project I used Google Collab and Visual Studio Code with Anaconda on Windows 10. Using Python 3.6

- I used different packages:
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- statsmodels.api
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- sklearn.metrics
	- tensorflow 2.X
	- google.colab (for the google colab use)
	- os
	- keras
	- datetime
	- TensorBoard
	- tensorflow_decision_forests

- You might install some packages before importing them with python such as "tensorflow_decision_forests"
  the command for installing it is !pip install tensorflow_decision_forests. If needed, use the same 
  command to install any package with !pip install $package$
